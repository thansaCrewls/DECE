Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened
I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery—air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, "This is what it is to be happy"
Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get
I've got nothing to do today but smile
Happiness is only real when shared
Letting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history, but not a part of your destiny
The worst part of success is trying to find someone who is happy for you
It's been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will
Learn to value yourself, which means: fight for your happiness
Happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world
It's like Tolstoy said. Happiness is an allegory, unhappiness a
Cry. Forgive. Learn. Move on. Let your tears water the seeds of your future happiness
Please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough. And I will always believe the same about you
I am not proud, but I am happy; and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride
I'm happy. Which often looks like crazy
If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present
All happiness depends on courage and work
The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer someone else up
I must learn to be content with being happier than I deserve
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts
I think and think and think, I’ve thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it
Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn't calculate his happiness
The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for
The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand
Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals
Happiness quite unshared can scarcely be called happiness; it has no taste
Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them
It was only a sunny smile, and little it cost in the giving, but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living
One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory
I'd far rather be happy than right any day
Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other people’s hands
Sometimes life knocks you on your ass... get up, get up, get up! Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them
Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy
Happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
Always find opportunities to make someone smile, and to offer random acts of kindness in everyday life
Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence
Happiness is an accident of nature, a beautiful and flawless aberration
Why wait for your happiness to come from your future blessings
There is no higher happiness than peace
